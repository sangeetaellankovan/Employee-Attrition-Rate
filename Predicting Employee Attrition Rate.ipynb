      "19   Can be better Some workshops may be more intensive compared to the others (iConnect / DevOps). I would prefer for that workshop to split itself into smaller sessions instead of squeezing the materials in a whole day since it can be difficult to digest the information properly. If possible, allocate a self-study period in between those sessions to allow us to be exposed to the materials better before moving on further. \\n\\nAt times, the tutorial/lab session could be much better. Despite being a hands-on session, sometimes it felt like we're just following through the steps in the lab documents assigned to us. It would have been more helpful if the tutor/lecturer would guide us through each step together and explain to us in greater detail.                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

      "23   not so bad Sharing of knowledge with project manager, I think it would be ideal if pm take into account the amount of training days we possibly might consumed (e.g. 22 days for one cert in a year), this will facilitate their forecasting in advance and not further overload on manpower. Also, just make this courses mandatory with option to opt out so more of my peers will be able to attend and not be rejected by pm. Not all of us have ownership of our time in projects, and not all of us have pm who are nurturing.

      "47   Educational. Fulfilling. Challenging. I have been pushed back a few batches for all my NUS-ISS course because i had to postpone my lessons to two months later. Because of that i am not with the same batch as 2nd June. Which would mean that i will need 2 more months to complete my full program. I want to suggest that, rather than pushing all my next modules too, just push the modules that i have to postpone. leave the rest as planned with the batch that i joined with.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

      "79   Poorly planned, overpriced, redundant. There are so many other cheaper options for NCS to choose from if the end goal is for the participants to get a masters degree cert. Seems more like a terrible attempt by NCS HR to stem the high staff turnover. Scrape it. Continue paying the fees for those who are still in the program but stop taking in new participants. Deep down, we all know this plan is a flop. Admit that NCS HR made a genuine mistake, and cut the losses asap.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

      "107  Overtime. Forced. Rushed. During the training phase, I think it would be nice to have lessons to cater for people who have no experience in software engineering. Such as on how exactly the Spring framework is used and how it works. During the training phase, we were just thrown into individual and group assignments with no knowledge on how angular/spring works. Since my cohort had 14 people, we were big enough to share information around. But I suspect if the cohort size is very small, it's going to be extremely difficult for them to catch up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

      "127  Underwhelming, disappointing, frustrating. There is little to no training that is provided to me as soon as I finish the bootcamp and am assigned to a project. I am assigned tasks without supervision/guidance as if I am expected to know how to carry it out despite being a software engineer trainee. And when I ask the seniors for help and guidance, they cant even be bothered to guide me properly. I realise that this is probably a project-to-project basis but as my first project, this is a frustrating experience to deal with. As a trainee software engineer, one should be trained before or guided while doing a task  but I have experienced none of this. It is also strange that my 2nd NUS-ISS course is scheduled almost 1 year after my first one, hence raising the question as to how much training we are actually getting in a calendar year when NUS-ISS courses are few and far between and there is little-to-no on-the-job training.    \n",

Include a beginner course of the tools that the participants will used. Improve the NCS tools (e.g. angular project generator) orientation, its too one sided and the instructors are not committed to teaching (they are just instructing the participants to follow the practical sheet), whereby participants are just following blindly.

      "157  Thankful, but exhausting Can explore the option of setting aside a longer period of absence from work (1mth+) to clear as many courses as possible together. Matching project schedule's downtime and NUS courses' schedule is usually difficult (my project has many key milestones in the timeline that coincides with many proposed course dates, which I can't take).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

      "174  Enriching\\nGrowth\\nPositive A possible improvement is to reassign NuCleuS program candidates to data analytics or data science projects for those in AABD. This allows NuCleuS Program Candidates to apply what they learnt immediately into the projects within NCS, thus possibly helping to progress the projects and increase productivity and efficiency within NCS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

      "127  underwhelming disappointing frustrating there is little to no training that is provided to me as soon as i finish the bootcamp and am assigned to a project i am assigned tasks without supervisionguidance as if i am expected to know how to carry it out despite being a software engineer trainee and when i ask the seniors for help and guidance they cant even be bothered to guide me properly i realise that this is probably a projecttoproject basis but as my first project this is a frustrating experience to deal with as a trainee software engineer one should be trained before or guided while doing a task  but i have experienced none of this it is also strange that my nd nusiss course is scheduled almost  year after my first one hence raising the question as to how much training we are actually getting in a calendar year when nusiss courses are few and far between and there is littletono onthejob training    \n",
